A collection of recipes to build Qualcomm Linux images for deb based
operating systems.

The main goal of this project is to provide mainline-centric images for
Qualcomm® IoT platforms as to demonstrate the state of upstream open source
software, help developers getting started, and support continuous development
and testing efforts.

Initially, this repository provides [debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos)
recipes based on Debian trixie for boards such as:

- [Qualcomm RB1](https://docs.qualcomm.com/doc/87-61720-1/87-61720-1_REV_A_QUALCOMM_ROBOTICS_RB1_PLATFORM__QUALCOMM_QRB2210__PRODUCT_BRIEF.pdf) (QRB2210)
- [Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2](https://docs.qualcomm.com/doc/87-74789-1/87-74789-1_REV_A_Qualcomm_RB3_Gen_2_Development_Kit_Product_Brief.pdf) (QCS6490)
- ...and more!

We are also working towards providing ready-to-use, pre-built images – stay
tuned!

## Requirements

[debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos) is required to build the debos
recipes. Recent debos packages should be available in Debian and Ubuntu
repositories; there are [debos installation
instructions](https://github.com/go-debos/debos?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-from-source-under-debian)
on the project's page, notably for Docker images and to build debos from
source. Make sure to use at least version 1.1.5 which supports setting the
sector size.

[qdl](https://github.com/linux-msm/qdl) is typically used for flashing. While
recent versions are available in Debian and Ubuntu, make sure to use at least
version 2.1 as it contains important fixes.

## Steps

### (optional) Build and flash U-Boot

U-Boot is needed for the RB1 board. If you are not targeting this board, you
can go to the next section.

Building U-Boot for the RB1 requires the following extra build-dependencies:

```bash
apt -y install git crossbuild-essential-arm64 make bison flex bc libssl-dev gnutls-dev xxd coreutils gzip mkbootimg
```

To build U-Boot for the RB1, run:

```bash
scripts/build-u-boot-rb1.sh
```

### (optional) Build custom kernel

Building a Linux kernel deb requires the following build-dependencies:
```bash
apt -y install git crossbuild-essential-arm64 make flex bison bc libdw-dev libelf-dev libssl-dev libssl-dev:arm64 dpkg-dev debhelper-compat kmod python3 rsync coreutils
```

Note that to install `libssl-dev:arm64` on a non-arm64 host, you will need to
enable arm64 as a foreign architecture first by running
`dpkg --add-architecture arm64 && apt update`.

Then, you can build a local Linux kernel deb from mainline with recommended config fragments:

```bash
scripts/build-linux-deb.py kernel-configs/*.config

# or from linux-next:
scripts/build-linux-deb.py --linux-next kernel-configs/*.config
```

### Build the image

To build flashable assets for all supported boards, follow these steps:

1. build tarballs of the root filesystem and DTBs
    ```bash
    make rootfs.tar

    # (optional) if you've built a local kernel, copy it to `debos-recipes/local-debs/`
    # and run this instead:
    #EXTRA_DEBOS_OPTS="-t localdebs:local-debs/ -t kernelpackage:none" make rootfs.tar
    ```

1. build disk and filesystem images from the root filesystem tarball
    ```bash
    # the default is to build a UFS image
    make disk-ufs.img

    # (optional) if you want SD card images or support for eMMC boards, run
    # this as well:
    make disk-sdcard.img
    ```

1. build flashable assets from downloaded boot binaries, the DTBs, and pointing at the UFS/SD card disk images
    ```bash
    make flash

    # (optional) if you've built U-Boot for the RB1, run this instead:
    #EXTRA_DEBOS_OPTS="-t u_boot_rb1:u-boot/rb1-boot.img" make flash

    # (optional) build only a subset of boards:
    #EXTRA_DEBOS_OPTS="-t target_boards:qcs615-ride,qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit" make flash
    ```

1. enter Emergency Download Mode (see section below) and flash the resulting images with QDL
    ```bash
    # for RB3 Gen2 Vision Kit or UFS boards in general
    cd flash_qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit_ufs
    qdl --storage ufs prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram[0-9].xml patch[0-9].xml

    # for RB1 or eMMC boards in general
    cd flash_qrb2210-rb1_emmc
    qdl --allow-missing --storage emmc prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram[0-9].xml patch[0-9].xml
    ```

#### Debos tips

By default, debos will try to pick a fast build backend. It will prefer to use its KVM backend (`-b kvm`) when available, and otherwise a UML environment (`-b uml`). If none of these work, a solid backend is QEMU (`-b qemu`). Because the target images are arm64, building under QEMU can be really slow, especially when building from another architecture such as amd64.

To build large images, the debos resource defaults might not be sufficient. Consider raising the default debos memory and scratchsize settings. This should provide a good set of minimum defaults:
```bash
debos --fakemachine-backend qemu --memory 1GiB --scratchsize 6GiB debos-recipes/qualcomm-linux-debian-image.yaml
```

#### Options for debos recipes

A few options are provided in the debos recipes; for the root filesystem recipe:

- `localdebs`: path to a directory with local deb packages to install (NB:
  debos expects relative pathnames)
- `xfcedesktop`: install an Xfce desktop environment; default: console only
  environment
- `overlays`: a `,`-separated list of rootfs overlays to add from
  `debos-recipes/overlays/`. Defaults to `qsc-deb-releases` to add our overlay
  apt repository that contains some package delta that isn't fully upstreamed
  and backported to trixie in Debian yet.
- `kernelpackage`: name of the kernel package to install from apt; defaults to
  `Debian’s linux-image-arm64`. Can (and should) be set to `none` if you are
  providing local kernel package instead.

For the image recipe:

- `dtb`: override the firmware provided device tree with one from the Linux
  kernel, e.g. `qcom/qcs6490-rb3gen2.dtb`; default: don't override
- `imagetype`: either `ufs` (the default) or `sdcard`; UFS images are named
  disk-ufs.img and use 4096-byte sectors and SD card images are named
  disk-sdcard.img and use 512-byte sectors
- `imagesize`: set the output disk image size; default: `6GiB`

For the flash recipe:

- `u_boot_rb1`: prebuilt U-Boot binary for RB1 in Android boot image format --
  see below (NB: debos expects relative pathnames)
- `target_boards`: comma-separated list of board names to build (default:
  `all`). Accepted values are the board names defined in the flash recipe, e.g.
  `qcs615-ride`, `qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit`, `qcs8300-ride`,
  `qcs9100-ride-r3`, `qrb2210-rb1`.

Note: Boards whose required device tree (.dtb) is not present in `dtbs.tar.gz` are automatically skipped during flash asset generation.

Deprecated flash options:
- `build_qcs615`, `build_qcm6490`, `build_qcs8300`, `build_qcs9100`, `build_rb1`: these per-family/per-board toggles are deprecated and will be removed. Use `target_boards` instead to select which boards to build.

Here are some example invocations:

```bash
# build the root filesystem with Xfce
debos -t xfcedesktop:true debos-recipes/qualcomm-linux-debian-rootfs.yaml

# build an image where systemd overrides the firmware device tree with the one
# for RB3 Gen2
debos -t dtb:qcom/qcs6490-rb3gen2.dtb debos-recipes/qualcomm-linux-debian-image.yaml

# build an SD card image
debos -t imagetype:sdcard debos-recipes/qualcomm-linux-debian-image.yaml

# build flash assets for a subset of boards
# (see flash recipe for accepted board names)
debos -t target_boards:qcs615-ride,qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit debos-recipes/qualcomm-linux-debian-flash.yaml
```

Note that these manual invocations may fail because the debos defaults, like
scratchsize, are too small for some recipes. We encourage you to stick to the
existing Makefile targets instead.

Under the hood, the Makefile just calls debos on recipes from the debos-recipes
directory, notably to set large enough memory and scratchsize settings. To pass
extra options to debos invocations, use `EXTRA_DEBOS_OPTS`, e.g.:

```
make EXTRA_DEBOS_OPTS="-t xfcedesktop:true" disk-ufs.img
```

### Flash the image

The `disk-sdcard.img` disk image can simply be written to an SD card, albeit most Qualcomm boards boot from internal storage by default. With an SD card, the board will use boot firmware from internal storage (eMMC or UFS) and do an EFI boot from the SD card if the firmware can't boot from internal storage.

For UFS boards, if there is no need to update the boot firmware, the `disk-ufs.img` disk image can also be flashed on the first LUN of the internal UFS storage with [qdl](https://github.com/linux-msm/qdl) and the provided `rawprogram-ufs.xml` file.

Put the board in "emergency download mode" (EDL; see next section) and run:
```bash
qdl --storage ufs prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram-ufs.xml
```
Make sure to use `prog_firehose_ddr.elf` for the target platform, such as this [version from the QCM6490 boot binaries](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/download/software/chip/qualcomm_linux-spf-1-0/qualcomm-linux-spf-1-0_test_device_public/r1.0_00058.0/qcm6490-le-1-0/common/build/ufs/bin/QCM6490_bootbinaries.zip) or this [version from the RB1 rescue image](https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/artifactory/clo-549-96boards-backup/96boards/rb1/linaro/rescue/23.12/rb1-bootloader-emmc-linux-47528.zip).

#### Emergency Download Mode (EDL)

In EDL mode, the board will receive a flashing program over its USB type-C cable, and that program will receive data to flash on the internal storage. This is a lower level mode than fastboot which is implemented by a higher-level bootloader.

To enter EDL mode:
1. remove power to the board
1. remove any cable from the USB type-C port
1. on some boards, it's necessary to set some DIP switches
1. press the `F_DL` button while turning the power on
1. connect a cable from the flashing host to the USB type-C port on the board
1. run qdl to flash the board

NB: It's also possible to run qdl from the host while the board is not connected, then start the board directly in EDL mode.

### Boot the image

#### Login

Once the image has booted, you can log in as the `debian` user, with the
default `debian` password. The image should then ask you to change this default
password to a safe one.

## Development

### Boot an image locally with QEMU (helper script)

Use the `scripts/run-qemu.py` helper to boot generated disk images under QEMU. It automatically:
- Detects your OS and locates an aarch64 UEFI firmware (Debian/Ubuntu: qemu-efi-aarch64; macOS Homebrew: edk2-aarch64).
- Presents the image via SCSI with the correct sector size (4096 for UFS, 512 for SD/eMMC).
- Creates a temporary qcow2 copy-on-write overlay by default (your base image remains unchanged).
- Provides GUI display by default (Gtk on Linux, Cocoa on macOS) and headless mode with `--headless`.

Dependencies:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install qemu-efi-aarch64 qemu-system-arm qemu-utils`
- macOS (Homebrew): `brew install qemu`

Basic usage:
```bash
# Auto-detects disk-ufs.img or disk-sdcard.img in the current directory
scripts/run-qemu.py

# Explicit storage type (sector size set accordingly)
scripts/run-qemu.py --storage ufs
scripts/run-qemu.py --storage sdcard

# Use a specific image path
scripts/run-qemu.py --image /path/to/disk-ufs.img

# Run headless (no GUI), with serial console on stdio
scripts/run-qemu.py --headless

# Disable the COW overlay to persist changes to the image
scripts/run-qemu.py --no-cow

# Pass extra QEMU arguments (example: 4 vCPUs and 4 GiB RAM)
scripts/run-qemu.py --qemu-args "-smp 4 -m 4096"
```

Notes:
- If neither `disk-ufs.img` nor `disk-sdcard.img` is found and `--image` is not provided, the script will exit with an error.
- On Linux, the script looks for `/usr/share/qemu-efi-aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd`. On macOS with Homebrew, it uses `share/qemu/edk2-aarch64-code.fd` from the `qemu` formula.
- The overlay is cleaned up automatically when QEMU exits. Use `--no-cow` to make changes persistent on the base image.
